Notes for Sean - 1/6/18

- Have yet to use TypeScript to make everything very pretty, wanted
	to make it work frist
- The website hides the ID when you curl to it to get the HTML.
	This means I cannot only grabs the rows from the disired table, 
	I grab all rows on the page. Right now, I am taking the rows 
	that have more than 3 fields, this breaks for some of the teams.
